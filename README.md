A new **offline** recipes manager in flutter, built with GetX and Moor

This application allows you to add, search and display your own recipes in your native language, all of this with local storage (no internet required at all!).

The goal is to replace the gourmet recipes manager that is unfortunately not maintained anymore.
Import from gourmet recipes manager will be available later.

As a bonus, this should work on all platforms (ios,android,web,macos,linux and maybe windows). However due to lack of time, first release will be focused on macos. Feel free to help!

## Getting Started

This is a WIP! Use at your own risks!

Supported languages:
  - English
  - Français
  - 日本語

Documentation will come later.
This is using flutter beta channel to have access to latest moor packages.
