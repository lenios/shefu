    "To Roast the Turkey:",
    "If using a frozen turkey, thaw in the refrigerator allowing at least 24 hours for every 4 pounds of turkey.",
    "Approximately 1 1/2 hours before cooking, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature.",
    "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Drain any juices from the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels.",
    "Place the turkey breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan.",
    "Tuck the wings under the turkey and secure the legs with kitchen twine if needed.",
    "Rub the turkey generously with the butter. Sprinkle evenly with seasoned salt.",
    "Place the turkey in the preheated oven.",
    "About 2/3 through cooking time, check to make sure the breast and tops of the legs aren't browning too quickly. If needed, cover the turkey loosely with a tent of aluminum foil to prevent overcooking.",
    "Turkey is done when the temperature in the thigh registers 180 degrees on a meat thermometer.",
    "Remove from the oven and let stand for at least 20 minutes before carving.",
    "To Make the Gravy:",
    "Remove drippings from the turkey roasting pan and place in a medium saucepan.",
    "Using a whisk, blend the flour into the pandrippings.",
    "Whisk in the stock or broth a little at a time",
    "Place the saucepan over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes."

    "questions": [
      {
      "question": "What if I don't have a roasting rack?",
      "answer": "If you don't have a roasting rack, you can form a coil of scrunched up aluminum foil to place in the bottom of your pan or use a bed of vegetables such as carrots and celery to keep the turkey raised off the bottom of the pan."
      },
      {
      "question": "How often should I baste the turkey?",
      "answer": "I skip it completely. Basting a turkey means frequently opening the oven door, which results in temperature fluctuations that can cause a dry turkey (particularly the breast meat). The butter rubbed all over will keep the turkey moist without the need for basting"
      },
      {
      "question": "I'm a little nervous about trying to handle that big bird. Advice?",
      "answer": "I get it. Moving that big, hot turkey around can be intimidating. So, you could always consider roasting two small ones instead! They'll cook faster, too, since you'll base your cooking time on the smaller weights."
      },
      {
      "question": "Do you cover the turkey when roasting?",
      "answer": "No. Don't cover the turkey while roasting. If you notice later in the cooking that the breast or legs are getting too brown, you can lightly place some foil over the top, but don't completely cover the turkey."
