  "title": "Christmas Pinwheel Cookies",
  "ingredients": [
    "12.75 oz all-purpose flour (3 cups)",
    "1 tsp baking powder",
    "½ tsp salt",
    "8 oz unsalted butter (1 cup), at room temperature)",
    "8.75 oz granulated sugar (1.25 cups)",
    "1 large egg (at room temperature)",
    "2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "Red and green food coloring (I used Americolor gel colors)",
    "6.75 oz sprinkles (1 cup)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl, and set aside temporarily.",
    "Combine the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a large stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix the butter and sugar together at medium speed for 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy.",
    "Turn the mixer to low, add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well-incorporated.",
    "With the mixer stil on low speed, slowly add the flour and mix until just a few streaks of flour remain. Stop the mixer, and finish scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The dough should be soft and supple but not sticky.",
    "Divide the dough into 3 equal parts. If you have a kitchen scale, each portion should be approximately 10 ounces.",
    "Leave one portion uncolored, and use gel food coloring to color the other two portions red and green. You can stir the food coloring in by hand, knead it in like bread dough, or mix it in using the mixer. (If you use the mixer, keep a close eye on the dough and run it for a short time so the dough doesn’t get overmixed and tough.)",
    "Form each color into a disc and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes, until firm.",
    "Roll each color out between two sheets of parchment to a long rectangle, approximately 6 x 13” long. Try to avoid adding additional flour at this step, or else the cookies might be tough. If the dough starts to feel too soft to work with at any point in the rolling/stacking process, chill it again in the refrigerator until you can work with it easily.",
    "Stack the dough rectangles on top of each other in this order: green, white, then red on top. Roll the dough up into a long, tight spiral.",
    "To roll the edges in sprinkles, brush the outside of the dough log with a very thin layer of corn syrup - you just want enough to make the sprinkles stick. Scatter the sprinkles on a baking sheet, and roll the log around the sprinkles, pressing it into the sprinkles so they adhere and it is completely covered. You can also skip this step and leave the edges plain.",
    "Wrap the dough log in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes, or until firm.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 F, and cover 2 baking sheets with parchment.",
    "Use a large, sharp chef’s knife to slice the log into rounds a little under ½” thick. (You can do thinner, ¼” rounds for a larger yield.) Place them on the baking sheets with a few inches between each cookie.",
    "Bake the cookies for 13-15 minutes, until they have spread and puffed, and no longer have a raw shine in the center. They will continue to cook for a few minutes after they’re out of the oven, so don’t wait until they feel firm in the center or they will be overcooked. The perfect pinwheel cookie is crunchy around the edges and soft and tender on the inside!",
    "Once cool, remove from the baking sheets and enjoy! Pinwheel cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature and should be enjoyed within 4-5 days for maximum freshness. Unbaked cookies can be frozen, well-wrapped, for up to 3 months."

      {
      "question": "What kind of sprinkles should I use?",
      "answer": "Many common sprinkle types will work for pinwheel cookies. You can use just 1 type of sprinkle, or a mix of multiple types–I like to make my own mixes by combining different sprinkles I own, so that my cookies have a variety of colors, shapes, and textures around the edges.Sprinkles that work well include: jimmies, nonpareils, sparkling sugar, sanding sugar, sequins, confetti/quins, and edible metallic glitter shapes. Sprinkles to avoid include: anything with chocolate (like Sixlets), anything made of hard candy (like candy cane pieces), anything too large (like some sugar pearls), or any royal icing pieces. If you aren’t sure if your sprinkles will work, you can always bake a test cookie using some dough scraps and see how they do!"
      },
      {
      "question": "Is it okay to bake the sprinkles?",
      "answer": "Yes! As long as you stick to the sprinkle types mentioned above, you should be fine. Some of them will probably bleed or melt a little, but you’ll still get the sparkling sprinkle effect. (This is also why I like using sprinkle mixes, because even if some melt, others will most likely be fine.) And of course, you can always skip the sprinkles entirely!"
      },
      {
      "question": "Tips for keeping your cookies round",
      "answer": "Here are my top tips for making sure the cookies look round when you bake them. 1. After wrapping the cookie dough log in plastic wrap, roll it until it seems nice and round before putting it in the fridge to chill. 2. If the cookie log develops a flat spot after removing it from the fridge, you can also do a little more rolling before cutting it. 3. Make sure that the cookie log is quite cold when you start to slice it. If it isn't well chilled the pressure of cutting with a knife can warp the shape of the cookies. 4. And, if despite your best efforts you still have a few wonky cookies, you can always do a little last minute shaping by hand. Just gently press them into a round shape as you place them on the cookie sheet."

      {
      "question": "Will this pinwheel method work with other recipes?",
      "answer": "I can’t guarantee it will work with your favorite recipe, but I can tell you that it is pretty flexible and forgiving! If you have a sugar/rolled cookie recipe that’s medium textured–meaning not too dry/stiff, and not extremely soft/sticky, then odds are good you can use this technique. If you do try other recipes, please come back and let us know how it goes!"
      },
      {
      "question": "Make-ahead and storage information",
      "answer": "Pinwheel cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature and should be enjoyed within 4-5 days for maximum freshness.If you want to make the dough in advance, you have a few options. You can freeze the whole rolled cookie log, wrapped well, for up to 3 months. I recommend letting it defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then adding the sprinkle layer, slicing, and baking as directed.You can also freeze individual unbaked cookie slices. I don’t recommend adding sprinkles if you are planning on freezing unbaked cookies, since many sprinkles will bleed color due to condensation. Freeze the sliced cookies in single layers in an airtight container or freezer zip-top bags for up to 3 months. To bake, let the frozen cookies sit at room temperature while the oven preheats, then add a few extra minutes to the baking time to make sure they’re baked all the way through.Finally, you can freeze baked cookies to eat later. Make sure to wrap them tightly and place them in a freezer safe container/storage bag to prevent freezer burn. For the best taste, thaw at room temperature, and enjoy the cookies within 3 months of their freeze date."
