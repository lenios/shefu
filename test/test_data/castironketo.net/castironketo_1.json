      {
        "question": "<strong>Do jalapenos have carbs?</strong>",
        "answer": "Yes, jalapenos contain low carbohydrates, with about 1 gram of net carbs in a medium-sized pepper. The majority of their carbs come from dietary fiber. Moderately including jalapenos in a keto or low-carb diet won't greatly affect carb intake."
